## Chall. 01: credchecker
#### Setup

![](/images/credchecker.png)

The first one. If we open up the [zipped file](https://github.com/mibho/mibho.github.io/raw/master/attachments/01_credchecker.7z) (password: flare), we see that it contains a folder and a .html file:

By opening "admin.html" with a browser, we're greeted with the following page:

Hmm.. I wonder what happens if we enter incorrect info. Does anything happen? 

## Analysis

Let's try some random stuff and see the result:

Moving on. 

Let's open "admin.html" with a text editor and examine the code. Nothing seems interesting until we arrive near the end of the file:

An encoded key ehh? But what type of encoding is it..?
(The big giveaway here is the ["=" at the end of the keystring](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6916805/why-does-a-base64-encoded-string-have-an-sign-at-the-end); ie, it's a **base-64 encoded string**.) There's nothing of interest in the function dataEntered()(it just makes sure neither field is blank), so let's move onto the next lines of code. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86342821/141476109-d0f07a97-f74f-43df-8f33-e3cb6c23b71b.png)

Immediately, there are a couple of things that grab my attention:

> line 133: if (**username.value == "Admin"** && **atob(password.value) == "goldenticket"**)

> line 135: var key = **atob**(encoded_key);
> 
> line 139: **flag** += String.fromCharCode(key.charCodeAt(i) ^ password.value.charCodeAt(i % password.value.length))

A quick google search reveals that **[atob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob)** decodes a base-64 encoded string. For lines 135 and 139 to be executed (ie, get the flag), the conditions for line 133 need to be satisfied:

1. username.value == "Admin"
2. atob(password.value) == "goldenticket"

## Solution

Since the first condition checks if the username entered is "Admin", let our username be Admin. This satisfies the first requirement and now we're left with figuring out 2). 

The second condition checks if the password in base-64 is "goldenticket". [Using google we can easily find a base-64 encoder/decoder.](https://www.base64encode.org/) 
Enter in "goldenticket" (w/o the quotes) and press Encode:

which yields the following:

base64("goldenticket") = Z29sZGVudGlja2V0

So the login credentials that'll give us our flag is:

> Username: Admin
> 
> Password: Z29sZGVudGlja2V0


Enter in the information and we get the following:
