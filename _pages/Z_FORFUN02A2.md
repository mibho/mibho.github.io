<h3>Speical Document part two starts here. Welcome to the special document part two. I am impressed  you have made it this far. But can you speak like
Mickey mouse? Can you speak like Mickey Mouse speaking chinese though? If you can, you prolly can complete this test successfully. But if not,
you still probably can pass this test. Now the test is the following: How fast am i typing? Pretty fast you must think. Yep, it's pretty fast.
I'm so fucking fast right now. Prolly can be so much faster but Im pretty fast right now. I can probably double the speed Im at right now. But, I need
to train and level up like 5 more times. FIVE more times. That four more than one. QUick Maths. But, what if I typed in another language??? What if
I trained in another language got super fast and so good and then i swithced to english???? Would I be like Rock Lee but in the typing realm??? 
Would I be like typing goku but without the weights??? Would I be like NBA superstar action man Michael B jordan???? Hmm.. These are such good 
questions that nobody has the answers too. Except me. Only me. I will have to search for these answers by going on a journey. This journey will be
recorded in this special document. This special document will then be special deliveries to myself but in the future. Maybe even the past. Only time
will tell..
